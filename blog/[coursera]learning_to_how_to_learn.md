# Learning to How to Learn
## 自言自语
- 当你学到一些知识后，你发现你不能提出些疑问或者有见解的问题。那么尝试去使用这些知识去创造些东西吧！Try to create some thing new!

## Chunking

- focus attention
- understand-(link),context(top down and bottom up)
- practice:
	- recall,try to pick out the key point without the book or try recalling the martiral which isn not your original learned-use you own words to synthesize the key concepts.
	- testing(conquer illusions of competence and realize the value of making mistake)
	- deliberate practice, avoiding overlearning
	- pay attension to the mistakes
- using interleaving: to create more different connection between chunks and get more flexibility.
- start from the diffcult thing.
- Lady luck favors the one who tires
- The ability to combine chunks in new and original ways **underlies** a lot of historical innovation.
## Seeing the big picture
- overlearning or interleave?
- deliberate practice, try to stay at the diffcult places.
