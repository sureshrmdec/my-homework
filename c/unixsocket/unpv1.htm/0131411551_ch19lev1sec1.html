<H3 class="docSection1Title">19.1 Introduction</H3>
<P class="docText">With the introduction of the security architecture for IP (IPsec, described in RFC 2401 [Kent and Atkinson 1998a]), a standard mechanism was needed to manage secret encryption and authorization keys. RFC 2367 [McDonald, Metz, and Phan 1998] introduces a generic key management API that can be used for IPsec and other network security services. Similar to routing sockets (<A class="docLink" HREF="0131411551_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</A>), this API creates a new protocol family, the <TT>PF_KEY</TT> domain. As with routing sockets, the only type of socket supported in the key domain is a raw socket.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><P class="docList">As described in <A class="docLink" HREF="0131411551_ch04lev1sec2.html#ch04lev1sec2">Section 4.2</A>, on most systems, <TT>AF_KEY</TT> would be defined to the same value as <TT>PF_KEY</TT>. However, RFC 2367 is quite specific that <TT>PF_KEY</TT> is the constant that must be used with key management sockets.</P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class="docText">Opening a raw key management socket requires privileges. On systems where privileges are segmented, there must be an individual privilege for opening key management sockets. On regular UNIX systems, opening a key management socket is limited to the superuser.</P>
<P class="docText">IPsec provides security services to packets based on <span class="docEmphasis">security associations</span>, or SAs. An SA describes a combination of source and destination addresses (and optionally, transport protocol and ports), mechanism (e.g., authentication), and keying material. More than one SA (e.g., authentication and encryption) can apply to a single stream of traffic. The set of security associations stored for use on a system is called the security association database, or SADB.</P>
<P class="docText">The SADB on a system may be used for more than just IPsec; for instance, OSPFv2, RIPv2, RSVP, and Mobile-IP may also have entries in the SADB. For this reason, <TT>PF_KEY</TT> sockets are not specific to IPsec.</P>
<P class="docText">IPsec also requires a <span class="docEmphasis">security policy</span> database, or SPDB. The security policy database describes requirements for traffic; for example, traffic between host A and host B must be authorized using IPsec AH, and any that is not must be dropped. The SADB describes how to perform the required security steps, such as, if traffic between host A and host B is using IPsec AH, then the SADB contains the algorithm and key to use. Unfortunately, there is no standard mechanism to maintain the SPDB. <TT>PF_KEY</TT> allows maintenance of the SADB, but not the SPDB. KAME's IPsec implementation uses <TT>PF_KEY</TT> extensions for SPDB maintenance, but there is no standard for this.</P>
<P class="docText">Three types of operations are supported on key management sockets:</P>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1"><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">A process can send a message to the kernel and all other processes with open key management sockets by writing to a key management socket. This is how SADB entries are added and deleted, and how processes that do their own security like OSPFv2 can request a key from a key management daemon.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">A process can read a message from the kernel (or another process) on a key management socket. The kernel can use this facility to request that a key management daemon install a security association for a new TCP session that policy requires be protected.</P></span></LI><LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><P class="docList">A process can send a dump request message to the kernel, and the kernel will reply with a dump of the current SADB. This is a debugging feature that may not be available on all systems.</P></span></LI></OL></span>
