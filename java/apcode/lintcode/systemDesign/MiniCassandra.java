/*
 * Cassandra is a NoSQL storage. The structure has two-level keys.

Level 1: raw_key. The same as hash_key or shard_key.
Level 2: column_key.
Level 3: column_value
raw_key is used to hash and can not support range query. let's simplify this to a string.
column_key is sorted and support range query. let's simplify this to integer.
column_value is a string. you can serialize any data into a string and store it in column value.

implement the following methods:

insert(raw_key, column_key, column_value)
query(raw_key, column_start, column_end) // return a list of entries

Example
insert("google", 1, "haha")
query("google", 0, 1)
>> [（1, "haha")]
